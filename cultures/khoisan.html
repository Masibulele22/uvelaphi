                <h3>Khoisan</h3>
                <p>
                    Khoisan /ˈkɔɪsɑːn/, or Khoe-Sān (pronounced [kxʰoesaːn]), according to the contemporary
                    Khoekhoegowab orthography, is a catch-all term for those indigenous peoples of Southern Africa who
                    do not speak one of the Bantu languages, combining the Khoekhoen (formerly "Khoikhoi") and the Sān
                    or Sākhoen (also, in Afrikaans: Boesmans, or in English: Bushmen, after Dutch: Boschjesmens; and
                    Saake in the Nǁng language).
                    <br><br>
                    Khoekhoen specifically were formerly known as "Hottentots", which was an onomatopoeic term (from
                    Dutch hot-en-tot) referring to the click consonants prevalent in the Khoekhoe languages, as they are
                    in all the languages grouped under Khoesān. Dutchmen in the early Cape settlement would ply
                    Khoekhoen with liquor as an inducement for them to perform a ritual dance. The
                    lyric accompanying the dance sounded in Dutch ears like hot-en-tot.
                    <br><br>
                    Sān are popularly thought of as foragers in the Kalahari Desert and regions of Botswana, Namibia,
                    Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and Northern South Africa. The word sān is from the Khoekhoe
                    language and simply refers to foragers ("those who pick things up from the ground") who do not own
                    livestock. As such, it was used in reference to all hunter-gatherer populations of the Southern
                    African region who Khoekhoe-speaking communities came into contact with and was largely a term
                    referring to a lifestyle, distinct from a pastoralist or agriculturalist one, and not to any
                    particular ethnicity. While there are attendant cosmologies and languages associated with this way
                    of life, the term is an economic designator rather than a cultural or ethnic one.
                    <br><br>
                    Khoekhoen is an ethnic designator. It refers to several populations which speak closely-related
                    languages and are considered to be the historical pastoralist communities in the South African Cape
                    region, through to Namibia, where Khoekhoe populations of Nama and Damara people are prevalent
                    ethnicities.
                    <br><br>
                    These Khoekhoe nations and Sān are grouped under the single term Khoesān as representing the
                    indigenous substrate population of Southern Africa prior to the hypothesised Bantu expansion
                    reaching the area roughly between 1,500 and 2,000 years ago.
                    <br><br>
                    Many Khoesān peoples are the direct descendants of a very early dispersal of anatomically modern
                    humans to Southern Africa before 150,000 years ago. Their languages show a vague typological
                    similarity, largely confined to the prevalence of click consonants. They are not verifiably derived
                    from a common proto-language, but are today split into at least three separate and unrelated
                    language families (Khoe-Kwadi, ǃUi-Taa and Kxʼa). It has been suggested that the Khoekhoeǁaen
                    (Khoekhoe peoples) may represent Late Stone Age arrivals to Southern Africa, possibly displaced by
                    Bantu immigration.
                    <br><br>
                    The compound term Khoisan / Khoesān is a modern anthropological convention in use since the
                    early-to-mid 20th century. Khoisan is a coinage by Leonhard Schulze in the 1920s and popularised by
                    Isaac Schapera. It entered wider usage from the 1960s based on the proposal of a "Khoisan"
                    language family by Joseph Greenberg.
                    <br><br>
                    During the Colonial/Apartheid era Afrikaans-speaking persons with partial Khoesān ancestry were
                    historically also grouped as Cape Blacks (Afrikaans: Kaap Swartes) or Western Cape Blacks
                    (Afrikaans: Wes-Kaap Swartes) to rather inaccurately distinguish them from the Bantu-speaking
                    peoples, the other indigenous African population of South Africa who also had significant Khoe-San
                    ancestry.
                    <br><br>
                    The term Khoisan (also spelled KhoiSan, Khoi-San, Khoe-San) has also been introduced in South
                    African usage as a self-designation after the end of apartheid in the late 1990s. Since the 2010s,
                    there has been a "Khoisan activist" movement, demanding recognition and land rights from the
                    government and white minority which owns large parts of the country's private land.
                </p><br>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <h4>Origins</h4>
                <p>
                    It is suggested that the ancestors of the modern Khoisan expanded to Southern Africa before 150,000
                    years ago, possibly as early as before 260,000 years ago, so that by the beginning of the
                    MIS 5 "megadrought" 130,000 years ago, there were two ancestral population clusters in Africa,
                    bearers of mt-DNA haplogroup L0 in southern Africa ancestral to the Khoi-San and bearers of
                    haplogroup L1-6 in central/eastern Africa ancestral to everyone else.
                    <br><br>
                    Due to their early expansion and separation, the populations ancestral to the Khoisan have been
                    estimated as having represented the "largest human population" during the majority of the
                    anatomically modern human timeline, from their early separation before 150 kya until the recent
                    peopling of Eurasia some 70 kya. They were much more widespread than today, their modern
                    distribution being due to their decimation in the course of the Bantu expansion. They were dispersed
                    throughout much of southern and southeastern Africa. There was also a significant back-migration of
                    bearers of L0 towards eastern Africa between 120 and 75 kya. Rito et al. (2013) speculate that
                    pressure from such back-migration may even have contributed to the dispersal of East African
                    populations out of Africa at about 70 kya.
                    <br><br>
                    "By ~130 ka two distinct groups of anatomically modern humans co-existed in Africa: broadly, the
                    ancestors of many modern-day Khoe and San populations in the south and a second central/eastern
                    African group that includes the ancestors of most extant worldwide populations. Early modern human
                    dispersals correlate with climate changes, particularly the tropical African "megadroughts" of MIS 5
                    (marine isotope stage 5, 135–75 ka) which paradoxically may have facilitated expansions in central
                    and eastern Africa, ultimately triggering the dispersal out of Africa of people carrying haplogroup
                    L3 ~60 ka. Two south to east migrations are discernible within haplogroup L0. One, between 120 and
                    75 ka, represents the first unambiguous long-range modern human dispersal detected by mtDNA and
                    might have allowed the dispersal of several markers of modernity. A second one, within the last 20
                    ka signalled by L0d, may have been responsible for the spread of southern click-consonant languages
                    to eastern Africa, contrary to the view that these eastern examples constitute relics of an ancient,
                    much wider distribution."
                </p><br>

                <h3>Late Stone Age</h3>
                <p>
                    The San populations ancestral to the Khoisan were spread throughout much of southern and eastern
                    Africa throughout the Late Stone Age after about 75 ka. A further expansion dated to about 20 ka has
                    been proposed based on the distribution of the L0d haplogroup. Rosti et al. suggest a connection of
                    this recent expansion with the spread of click consonants to eastern African languages (Hadza
                    language).
                    <br><br>
                    The Late Stone Age Sangoan industry occupied southern Africa in areas where annual rainfall is less
                    than a metre (1000 mm; 39.4 in). The contemporary San and Khoi peoples resemble those
                    represented by the ancient Sangoan skeletal remains.
                    <br><br>
                    Against the traditional interpretation that finds a common origin for the Khoi and San, other
                    evidence has suggested that the ancestors of the Khoi peoples are relatively recent pre-Bantu
                    agricultural immigrants to southern Africa who abandoned agriculture as the climate dried and either
                    joined the San as hunter-gatherers or retained pastoralism.
                    <br><br>
                    With the hypothesized arrival of pastoralists & bantoid agro-pastoralists in southern Africa
                    starting around 2,300 years ago, linguistic development is later seen in the click consonants and
                    loan words from ancient Khoe-san languages into the evolution of blended agro-pastoralist &
                    hunter-gatherer communities that would eventually evolve into the now extant, amalgamated modern
                    native linguistic communities found in South Africa, Botswana & Namibia (e.g. in South African
                    Xhosa, Sotho, Tswana, Zulu people.)
                    <br><br>
                    Today these groups represent the quantitative majority of extant admixed ancient Khoe-San
                    descendants by the millions.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Historical period</h3>
                <p>
                    The Khoikhoi enter the historical record with their first contact with Portuguese explorers, about
                    1,000 years after their displacement by the Bantu. Local population dropped after the Khoi were
                    exposed to smallpox from Europeans. The Khoi waged more frequent attacks against Europeans when the
                    Dutch East India Company enclosed traditional grazing land for farms. Khoikhoi social organisation
                    was profoundly damaged and, in the end, destroyed by colonial expansion and land seizure from the
                    late 17th century onwards. As social structures broke down, some Khoikhoi people settled on farms
                    and became bondsmen (bondservants) or farm workers; many were incorporated into existing Khoi clan
                    and family groups of the Xhosa people.
                    <br><br>
                    Georg Schmidt, a Moravian Brother from Herrnhut, Saxony, now
                    Germany, founded Genadendal in 1738, which was the first mission station in southern Africa,
                    among the Khoi people in Baviaanskloof in the Riviersonderend Mountains. Early European settlers
                    sometimes intermarried with Khoikhoi women, resulting in a sizeable mixed-race population now known
                    as the Griqua. The Griqua people too would migrate to what was by that time the frontierlands of the
                    Xhosa native reserves and establish Griqualand East, which contained a mostly Xhosa population.
                    <br><br>
                    Andries Stockenström facilitated the creation of the "Kat River" Khoi settlement near the eastern
                    frontier of the Cape Colony. The settlements thrived and expanded, and Kat River quickly became a
                    large and successful region of the Cape that subsisted more or less autonomously. The people were
                    predominantly Afrikaans-speaking Gonaqua Khoi, but the settlement also began to attract other Khoi,
                    Xhosa and mixed-race groups of the Cape.
                    <br><br>
                    The so-called "Bushman wars" were to a large extent the response of the San after their
                    dispossession.
                    <br><br>
                    At the start of the 18th century, the Khoikhoi in the Western Cape lived in a co-operative state
                    with the Dutch. By the end of the century the majority of the Khoisan operated as 'wage labourers',
                    not that dissimilar to slaves. Geographically, the further away the labourer was from Cape Town, the
                    more difficult it became to transport agricultural produce to the markets. The issuing of grazing
                    licences north of the Berg River in what was then the Tulbagh Basin propelled colonial expansion in
                    the area. This system of land relocation led to the Khoijhou losing their land and livestock as well
                    as dramatic change in the social, economic and political development.
                    <br><br>
                    After the defeat of the Xhosa rebellion in 1853, the new Cape Government endeavoured to grant the
                    Khoi political rights to avert future racial discontent. The government enacted the Cape franchise
                    in 1853, which decreed that all male citizens meeting a low property test, regardless of colour, had
                    the right to vote and to seek election in Parliament. This non-racial principle was later abolished
                    by the apartheid Government.
                    <br><br>
                    In the Herero and Namaqua genocide in German South-West Africa, over 10,000 Nama are estimated to
                    have been killed during 1904–1907.
                    <br><br>
                    The San of the Kalahari were described in Specimens of Bushman Folklore by Wilhelm H. I. Bleek and
                    Lucy C. Lloyd (1911). They were brought to the globalised world's attention in the 1950s by South
                    African author Laurens van der Post in a six-part television documentary. The Ancestral land
                    conflict in Botswana concerns the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR), established in 1961 for
                    wildlife, while the San were permitted to continue their hunter-gatherer lifestyle.
                    <br><br>
                    In the 1990s,
                    the government of Botswana began a policy of "relocating" CKGR residents outside the reserve. In
                    2002, the government cut off all services to CKGR residents. A legal battle began, and in 2006 the
                    High Court of Botswana ruled that the residents had been forcibly and unconstitutionally removed.
                    The policy of relocation continued, however, and in 2012 the San people (Basarwa) appealed to the
                    United Nations to force the government to recognise their land and resource rights.
                    <br><br>
                    Following the end of Apartheid in 1994, the term "Khoisan" has gradually come to be used as a
                    self-designation by South African Khoikhoi as representing the "first nations" of South Africa
                    vis-a-vis the ruling Bantu majority. A conference on "Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage" was
                    organised by the University of the Western Cape in 1997. and "Khoisan activism" has been
                    reported in the South African media beginning in 2015.
                    <br><br>
                    The South African government allowed Khoisan families (up until 1998) to pursue land claims which
                    existed prior to 1913. The South African Deputy Chief Land Claims Commissioner, Thami Mdontswa, has
                    said that constitutional reform would be required to enable Khoisan people to pursue further claims
                    to land from which their direct ancestors were removed prior to 9 June 1913.

                <h3>Discoveries</h3>
                <p>
                    In 2019, scientists from the University of the Free State discovered 8,000-year-old carvings made by
                    the Khoisan people. The carvings depicted a hippopotamus, horse, and antelope in the 'Rain Snake'
                    Dyke of the Vredefort structure, which may have spiritual significance regarding the rain-making
                    mythology of the Khoisan.

                <h3>Violence against the Khoisan</h3>
                <h4>Herero and Namaqua Genocide</h4>
                <p>
                    In the Herero and Namaqua genocide, about 10,000 Nama, a Khoekhoe group, and an unknown number of
                    San people were killed in an extermination campaign by the German Colonial Empire between 1904 and
                    1908.

                <h3>Forced relocation in Botswana</h3>
                <p>
                    In Botswana, many of the indigenous San people have been forcibly relocated from their land to
                    reservations. To make them relocate, they were denied access to water on their land and faced arrest
                    if they hunted, which was their primary source of food. Their lands lie in the middle of the
                    world's richest diamond field. Officially, the government denies that there is any link to mining
                    and claims the relocation is to preserve the wildlife and ecosystem, even though the San people have
                    lived sustainably on the land for millennia. On the reservations they struggle to find
                    employment, and alcoholism is rampant.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Languages</h3>
                <p>
                    The "Khoisan languages" were proposed as a linguistic phylum by Joseph Greenberg in 1955. Their
                    genetic relationship was questioned later in the 20th century, and the term now serves mostly as a
                    convenience term without implying genetic unity, much like "Papuan" and "Australian" are. Their
                    most notable uniting feature is their click consonants.

                    They are categorized in two families, and a number of possible language isolates.
                    <br><br>
                    The Kxʼa family was proposed in 2010, combining the ǂʼAmkoe (ǂHoan) language with the ǃKung (Juu)
                    dialect cluster. ǃKung includes about a dozen dialects, with no clear-cut delineation between them.
                    Sands et al. (2010) propose a division into four clusters:
                    <br><br>
                    Northern ǃKung (Sekele), spoken in Angola around the Cunene, Cubango, Cuito, and Cuando rivers (but
                    with many refugees now in Namibia),
                    North-Central ǃKung (Ekoka), spoken in Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border,
                    Central ǃKung, spoken around Grootfontein, Namibia, west of the central Omatako River and south of
                    the Ovambo River
                    Southeastern ǃKung (Juǀ'hoan), spoken in Botswana east of the Okavango Delta, and northeast Namibia
                    from near Windhoek to Rundu, Gobabis, and the Caprivi Strip.
                    <br><br>
                    The Khoi (Khoe) family is divided into a Khoikhoi (Khoekhoe and Khoemana dialects) and a Kalahari
                    (Tshu–Khwe) branch. The Kalahari branch of Khoe includes Shua and Tsoa (with dialects), and Kxoe,
                    Naro, Gǁana and ǂHaba (with dialects). Khoe also has been tentatively aligned with Kwadi
                    ("Kwadi–Khoe"), and more speculatively with the Sandawe language of Tanzania ("Khoe–Sandawe"). The
                    Hadza language of Tanzania has been associated with the Khoisan group due to the presence of click
                    consonants.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Physical characteristics and genetics</h3>
                <p>
                    Charles Darwin wrote about the Khoisan and sexual selection in The Descent of Man in 1882,
                    commenting that their steatopygia, seen primarily in females, evolved through sexual selection in
                    human evolution, and that "the posterior part of the body projects in a most wonderful manner".
                    Historically, some females were observed by anthropologists to exhibit elongated labia minora, which
                    sometimes projected as much as 10 cm below the vulva when standing. Though well documented, the
                    motivations behind this practice and the voices of the women who perform it are rarely explored in
                    the research.
                    <br><br>
                    In the 1990s, genomic studies of the world's peoples found that the Y chromosome of San men share
                    certain patterns of polymorphisms that are distinct from those of all other populations. Because
                    the Y chromosome is highly conserved between generations, this type of DNA test is used to determine
                    when different subgroups separated from one another, and hence their last common ancestry. The
                    authors of these studies suggested that the San may have been one of the first populations to
                    differentiate from the most recent common paternal ancestor of all extant humans.
                    <br><br>
                    Various Y-chromosome studies since confirmed that the Khoisan carry some of the most
                    divergent (oldest) Y-chromosome haplogroups. These haplogroups are specific sub-groups of
                    haplogroups A and B, the two earliest branches on the human Y-chromosome tree.
                    <br><br>
                    Similar to findings from Y-chromosome studies, mitochondrial DNA studies also showed evidence that
                    the Khoisan people carry high frequencies of the earliest haplogroup branches in the human
                    mitochondrial DNA tree. The most divergent (oldest) mitochondrial haplogroup, L0d, has been
                    identified at its highest frequencies in the southern African Khoi and San groups.
                    The distinctiveness of the Khoisan in both matrilineal and patrilineal groupings is a further
                    indicator that they represent a population historically distinct from other Africans.

                <h3>Research and academic centre</h3>
                <p>
                    On 21 September 2020 the University of Cape Town launched its new Khoi and San Centre, with an
                    undergraduate degree programme planned to be rolled out in coming years. The centre will support and
                    consolidate this collaborative work on research commissions on language (including Khoekhoegowab),
                    sacred human remains, land and gender. Many descendants of Khoisan people still live on the Cape
                    Flats.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Khoekhoe</h3>
                <p>
                    Khoekhoen (singular Khoekhoe) (or Khoikhoi in the former orthography; formerly also
                    Hottentots) are the traditionally nomadic pastoralist indigenous population of southwestern
                    Africa. They are often grouped with the hunter-gatherer San (literally "Foragers") peoples. The
                    designation "Khoekhoe" is actually a kare or praise address, not an ethnic endonym, but it has been
                    used in the literature as an ethnic term for Khoe-speaking peoples of Southern Africa, particularly
                    pastoralist groups, such as the !Ora, !Gona, Nama, Xiri and ǂNūkhoe nations.

                    While the presence of Khoekhoen in Southern Africa predates the Bantu expansion, according to a
                    scientific theory based mainly on linguistic evidence, it is not clear when the Khoekhoen began
                    inhabiting the areas where the first contact with Europeans occurred (possibly in the Late Stone
                    Age). At that time, in the 17th century, the Khoekhoen maintained large herds of Nguni cattle in
                    the Cape region. They mostly gave up nomadic pastoralism in the 19th to 20th century.

                    Their Khoekhoe language is related to certain dialects spoken by foraging San peoples of the
                    Kalahari, such as the Khwe and Tshwa, forming the Khoe language family. The main Khoekhoe
                    subdivisions today are the Nama people of Namibia, Botswana and South Africa (with numerous clans),
                    the ǂNūkhoeǃhaos of Namibia, the !Orana clans of South Africa (such as ǀHõakhoena or AmaNgqosini),
                    the Xirikua or Griekwa nation of South Africa, and the AmaGqunukhwebe or !Gona clans which fall
                    under the Xhosa-speaking polities.

                    The Xirikua clans (Griqua) developed their own ethnic identity in the 19th century and settled in
                    Griqualand. They are related to the same kinds of clan formations as the Rehoboth Basters, who could
                    also be considered a "Khoekhoe" people.
                </p><br>

                <h3>History</h3>
                <h4>Early history</h4>
                <p>

                    The broad ethnic designation of "Khoekhoen", meaning the peoples originally part of a pastoral
                    culture and language group to be found across Southern Africa, is thought to refer to a population
                    originating in the northern area of modern Botswana. This culture steadily spread southward,
                    eventually reaching the Cape approximately 2,000 years ago. "Khoekhoe" groups include ǀAwakhoen to
                    the west, and ǀKx'abakhoena of South and mid-South Africa, and the Eastern Cape. Both of these terms
                    mean "Red People", and are equivalent to the IsiXhosa term "amaqaba". Husbandry of sheep, goats and
                    cattle grazing in fertile valleys across the region provided a stable, balanced diet, and allowed
                    these lifestyles to spread, with larger groups forming in a region previously occupied by the
                    subsistence foragers.
                    <br>
                    Ntu-speaking agriculturalist culture is thought to have entered the region in
                    the 3rd century AD, pushing pastoralists into the Western areas. The example of the close relation
                    between the ǃUriǁ’aes (High clan), a cattle keeping population, and the !Uriǁ’aeǀ’ona (High clan
                    children), a more-or-less sedentary forager population (also known as "Strandlopers"), both
                    occupying the area of ǁHuiǃgaeb, shows that the strict distinction between these two lifestyles is
                    unwarranted, as well as the ethnic categories that are derived. Foraging peoples who ideologically
                    value non-accumulation as a social value system would be distinct, however, but the distinctions
                    among “Khoekhoe pastoralists”, “San hunter-gatherers” and “Bantu agriculturalists” do not hold up to
                    scrutiny, and appear to be historical reductionism.
                </p>

                <h4>Arrival of Europeans</h4>
                <p>
                    Khoe-speaking peoples traded with seafarers from all over the globe for centuries, going back into
                    ancient times, and this undoubtedly included some Europeans, perhaps even Roman vessels, but
                    Portuguese explorers and merchants are the first to record their contacts, in the 15th and 16th
                    centuries AD. The ongoing encounters were often violent. In 1510, at the Battle of Salt River,
                    Francisco de Almeida and fifty of his men were killed and his party were defeated by
                    ox-mounted !Uriǁ’aekua ("Goringhaiqua" in Dutch approximate spelling), which was one of the
                    so-called Khoekhoe clans of the area that also included the !Uriǁ’aeǀ’ona ("Goringhaicona", also
                    known as "Strandlopers"), said to be the ancestors of the !Ora nation of today. In the late 16th
                    century, Portuguese, French, Danish, Dutch and English but mainly Portuguese ships regularly
                    continued to stop over in Table Bay en route to the Indies. They traded tobacco, copper and iron
                    with the Khoekhoe-speaking clans of the region, in exchange for fresh meat.
                    <br><br>
                    Local population dropped after smallpox contagion was spread through European activity. The
                    Khoe-speaking clans suffered high mortality as immunity to the disease was rare. This increased, as
                    military conflict with the intensification of the colonial expansion of the United East India
                    Company that began to enclose traditional grazing land for farms. Over the following century, the
                    Khoe-speaking peoples were steadily driven off their land, resulting in numerous northwards
                    migrations, and the reformulation of many nations and clans, as well as the dissolution of many
                    traditional structures.
                    <br><br>
                    "Khoekhoe" social organisation was thus profoundly damaged by the colonial expansion and land
                    seizure from the late 17th century onwards. As social structures broke down, many Khoekhoen settled
                    on farms and became bondsmen (bondservants, serfs) or farm workers; others were incorporated into
                    clans that persisted. Georg Schmidt, a Moravian Brother from Herrnhut, Saxony, now Germany, founded
                    Genadendal in 1738, which was the first mission station in Southern Africa, among the
                    Khoe-speaking peoples in Baviaanskloof in the Riviersonderend Mountains.
                    <br><br>
                    The colonial designation of "Baasters" came to refer to any clans that had European ancestry in some
                    part and adopted certain Western cultural traits. Though these were later known as Griqua (Xirikua
                    or Griekwa) they were known at the time as "Basters" and in some instances are still so called, e.
                    g., the Bosluis Basters of the Richtersveld and the Baster community of Rehoboth, Namibia, mentioned
                    above.
                    <br><br>
                    Arguably responding to the influence of missionaries, the states of Griqualand West and Griqualand
                    East were established by the Kok dynasty; these were later absorbed into the Cape Colony of the
                    British Empire.
                    <br><br>
                    Beginning in the late 18th century, Oorlam communities migrated from the Cape Colony north to
                    Namaqualand. They settled places earlier occupied by the Nama. They came partly to escape Dutch
                    colonial conscription, partly to raid and trade, and partly to obtain herding lands. Some of
                    these emigrant Oorlams (including the band led by the outlaw Jager Afrikaner and his son Jonker
                    Afrikaner in the Transgariep) retained links to Oorlam communities in or close to the borders of the
                    Cape Colony. In the face of gradual Boer expansion and then large-scale Boer migrations away from
                    British rule at the Cape, Jonker Afrikaner brought his people into Namaqualand by the mid-19th
                    century, becoming a formidable force for Oorlam domination over the Nama and against the
                    Bantu-speaking Hereros for a period.
                </p><br>

                <h3>Kat River settlement (1829–1856) and Khoena in the Cape Colony</h3>
                <p>
                    By the early 1800s, the remaining Khoe-speakers of the Cape Colony suffered from restricted civil
                    rights and discriminatory laws on land ownership. With this pretext, the powerful Commissioner
                    General of the Eastern Districts, Andries Stockenstrom, facilitated the creation of the "Kat River"
                    Khoe settlement near the eastern frontier of the Cape Colony. The more cynical motive was probably
                    to create a buffer-zone on the Cape's frontier, but the extensive fertile land in the region allowed
                    people to own their land and build communities in peace. The settlements thrived and expanded, and
                    Kat River quickly became a large and successful region of the Cape that subsisted more or less
                    autonomously. The people were predominantly Afrikaans-speaking !Gonakua, but the settlement also
                    began to attract other diverse groups.
                    <br><br>
                    Khoekua were known at the time for being very good marksmen, and were often invaluable allies of the
                    Cape Colony in its frontier wars with the neighbouring Xhosa politics. In the Seventh Frontier War
                    (1846–1847) against the Gcaleka, the Khoekua gunmen from Kat River distinguished themselves under
                    their leader Andries Botha in the assault on the "Amatola fastnesses". (The young John Molteno,
                    later Prime Minister, led a mixed commando in the assault, and later praised the Khoekua as having
                    more bravery and initiative than most of his white soldiers.)
                    <br><br>
                    However, harsh laws were still implemented in the Eastern Cape, to encourage the Khoena to leave
                    their lands in the Kat River region and to work as labourers on white farms. The growing resentment
                    exploded in 1850. When the Xhosa rose against the Cape Government, large numbers Khoeǀ’ona joined
                    the Xhosa rebels for the first time. After the defeat of the rebellion and the granting of
                    representative government to the Cape Colony in 1853, the new Cape Government endeavoured to grant
                    the Khoena political rights to avert future racial discontent.
                    <br><br>
                    Attorney General William Porter was
                    famously quoted as saying that he "would rather meet the Hottentot at the hustings, voting for his
                    representative, than meet him in the wilds with his gun upon his shoulder". Thus, the government
                    enacted the Cape franchise in 1853, which decreed that all male citizens meeting a low property
                    test, regardless of colour, had the right to vote and to seek election in Parliament. However, this
                    non-racial principle was eroded in the late 1880s by a literacy test, and later abolished by the
                    Apartheid Government.

                <h3>Massacres in German South-West Africa</h3>
                <p>From 1904 to 1907, the Germans took up arms against the Khoikhoi group living in what was then German
                    South-West Africa, along with the Herero. Over 10,000 Nama, more than half of the total Nama
                    population at the time, may have died in the conflict. This was the single greatest massacre ever
                    witnessed by the Khoikhoi people.
                </p><br>

                <h5>Culture</h5>
                <h4>Religion</h4>
                <p>
                    The religious mythology of the Khoe-speaking cultures gives special significance to the Moon, which
                    may have been viewed as the physical manifestation of a supreme being associated with heaven.
                    Thiǁoab (Tsui'goab) is also believed to be the creator and the guardian of health, while ǁGaunab is
                    primarily an evil being, who causes sickness or death. Many Khoe-speakers have converted to
                    Christianity and Nama Muslims make up a large percentage of Namibia's Muslims.
                </p>

                <h4>World Heritage</h4>
                <p>
                    UNESCO has recognised Khoe-speaking culture through its inscription of the Richtersveld as a World
                    Heritage Site. This important area is the only place where transhumance practices associated with
                    the culture continue to any great extent.

                    The International Astronomical Union named the primary component of the binary star Mu¹ Scorpii
                    after the traditional Khoekhoe language name Xami di mûra ('eyes of the lion').

                <h3>List of Khoekhoe peoples</h3>
                <p>
                    The classification of Khoikhoi peoples can be broken down roughly into two groupings: Northern
                    Khoikhoi & Southern Khoikhoi (Cape Khoi).
                </p><br>

                <h4>Northern Khoikhoi</h4>
                <p>

                    The Northern Khoikhoi are referred to as the Nama or Namaqua and they have among them 11 formal
                    clans:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Khaiǁkhaun (Red Nation) at Hoachanas, the main group and the oldest Nama clan in Namibia</li>
                    <li>
                        ǀKhowesen (Direct descendants of Captain Hendrik Witbooi) who was killed in the battle with
                        Germans
                        on 29 October 1905. The |Khowesin, reside in modern-day Gibeon under the leadership of Ismael
                        Hendrik Witbooi the 9th Gaob (meaning captain) of the |Khowesen Gibeon, situated 72 km south of
                        Mariental and 176 km north of Keetmanshoop just off the B1, was originally known by the name
                        Khaxa-tsûs. It received its name from Kido Witbooi first Kaptein of the ǀKhowesin.</li>
                    <li>ǃGamiǂnun (Bondelswarts) at Warmbad</li>
                    <li>ǂAonin (Southern Topnaars) at Rooibank</li>
                    <li>ǃGomen (Northern Topnaars) at Sesfontein</li>
                    <li>
                        ǃKharakhoen (Fransman Nama) at Gochas. After being defeated by Imperial Germany's Schutztruppe
                        in
                        the Battle of Swartfontein on 15 January 1905, this Nama group split into two. Part of the
                        ǃKharakhoen fled to Lokgwabe, Botswana, and stayed there permanently,[21] the part that remained
                        on
                        South West African soil relocated their tribal centre to Amper-Bo. In 2016 David Hanse was
                        inaugurated as chief of the clan.</li>
                    <li>ǁHawoben (Veldschoendragers) at Koës</li>
                    <li>!Aman at Bethanie which was led by Cornelius Frederick</li>
                    <li>ǁOgain (Groot Doden) at Schlip</li>
                    <li>ǁKhauǀgoan (Swartbooi Nama) at Rehoboth, later at Salem, Ameib, and Franzfontein</li>
                    <li>Kharoǃoan (Keetmanshoop Nama) under the leadership of Hendrik Tseib[23] split from the Red
                        Nation in
                        February 1850 and settled at Keetmanshoop.</li>
                    <p>
                        Among the Namaqua are also the Oorlams who are a southern Khoikhoi people of mixed-race ancestry
                        that trekked northwards over the Orange River and where absorbed into the greater Nama identity.
                        The
                        Oorlams themselves are made up of 5 smaller clans:
                    </p>

                    <li>ǀAixaǀaen (Orlam Afrikaners), the first group to enter and permanently settle in Namibia. Their
                        leader Klaas Afrikaner left the Cape Colony around 1770. The clan first built the fortress of
                        ǁKhauxaǃnas, then moved to Blydeverwacht, and finally settled at Windhoek.</li>
                    <li>ǃAman (Bethanie Orlam) subtribe settled at Bethanie at the turn of the eighteenth century.
                        Kaiǀkhauan (Khauas Nama) subtribe formed in the 1830s, when the Vlermuis clan merged with the
                        Amraal
                        family. Their home settlement became Naosanabis (now Leonardville), which they occupied from
                        1840 onward. This clan ceased to exist after military defeat by Imperial German Schutztruppe in
                        1894 and 1896.</li>
                    <li>
                        ǀHaiǀkhauan (Berseba Orlam) subtribe formed in 1850, when the Tibot and Goliath families split
                        from
                        the ǃAman to found Berseba.</li>
                    <li>
                        ǀKhowesin (Witbooi Orlam) subtribe was the last to take up settlement in Namibia. They
                        originated at
                        Pella, south of the Orange River. Their home town became Gibeon.
                    </li>

                    <p>
                        These Namaqua inhabit the Great Namaqualand region of Namibia. There are also minor Namaqua
                        clans
                        that inhabit the Little Namaqualand regions south of the Orange River in north western South
                        Africa.

                        The southern band of Khoekhoe peoples (Sometimes also called the Cape Khoi) inhabit the Western
                        Cape and Eastern Cape Provinces in the south western coastal regions of South Africa. They are
                        further divided into 4 subgroups, Eastern Cape Khoi, Central Cape Khoi, Western Cape Khoi and
                        Peninsular Cape Khoi.

                    <h5>Early European theories about Khoekhoe origins</h5>
                    <p>
                        European theories about the origins of the Khoekhoe are historically interesting in their own
                        right. Of the European theories proposed, notable is that summarised in the commissioned Grammar
                        and Dictionary of the Zulu Language. Published in 1859, this put forward the idea of an
                        origin from Egypt that appears to have been popular amongst men of learning in the region.
                        The reasoning for this included the (supposed) distinctive Caucasian elements of the Khoekhoe's
                        appearance, a "wont to worship the moon'", an apparent similarity to the antiquities of Old
                        Egypt, and a "very different language" to their neighbours. The Grammar says that "the best
                        philologists of the present day ... find marked resemblances between the two". This conviction
                        is echoed in an introduction to the Zulu language, which avidly often comments upon the
                        language's various resemblances to Hebrew.

                    <h3>San People</h3>
                    <p>
                        The San peoples (also Saan), or Bushmen, are members of various Khoe, Tuu, or Kxʼa-speaking
                        indigenous hunter-gatherer cultures that are the first cultures of Southern Africa, and whose
                        territories span Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Lesotho and South Africa. In
                        2017, Botswana was home to approximately 63,500 San people, which is roughly 2.8% of the
                        country's population, making it the country with the highest population of San people.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Definition</h3>
                    <p>
                        The term "Sann" has a long vowel and is spelled Sān (in Khoekhoegowab orthography). It is a
                        Khoekhoe exonym with the meaning of "foragers" and was often used in a derogatory manner to
                        describe nomadic, foraging people. Based on observation of lifestyle, this term has been applied
                        to speakers of three distinct language families living between the Okavango River in Botswana
                        and Etosha National Park in northwestern Namibia, extending up into southern Angola; central
                        peoples of most of Namibia and Botswana, extending into Zambia and Zimbabwe; and the southern
                        people in the central Kalahari towards the Molopo River, who are the last remnant of the
                        previously extensive indigenous "San" of South Africa.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Names</h3>
                    <p>
                        The endonyms used by San themselves refer to their individual nations, including the ǃKung
                        (ǃXuun) (subdivisions ǂKxʼaoǁʼae (Auen), Juǀʼhoan, etc.) the Tuu (subdivisions ǀXam, Nusan
                        (Nǀu), ǂKhomani, etc.) and Tshu–Khwe groups such as the Khwe (Khoi, Kxoe), Haiǁom, Naro, Tsoa,
                        Gǁana (Gana) and Gǀui (ǀGwi). Representatives of San peoples in 2003 stated their
                        preference for the use of such individual group names where possible over the use of the
                        collective term San.
                        <br><br>
                        The designations "Bushmen" and "San" are both exonyms in origin, but San had been widely adopted
                        as an endonym by the late 1990s. "San" originates as a pejorative Khoekhoe appellation for
                        foragers without cattle or other wealth, from a root saa "picking up from the ground" + plural
                        -n in the Haiǁom dialect. The term Bushmen, from 17th-century Dutch Bosjesmans, is still
                        widely used by others and to self-identify, but in some instances the term has also been
                        described as pejorative.
                        <br><br>
                        Adoption of the Khoekhoe term San in Western anthropology dates to the 1970s, and this remains
                        the standard term in English-language ethnographic literature, although some authors later
                        switched back to using the name Bushmen. The compound Khoisan, used to refer to the
                        pastoralist Khoi and the foraging San collectively, was coined by Leonhard Schulze in the 1920s
                        and popularised by Isaac Schapera in 1930, and anthropological use of San was detached from the
                        compound Khoisan, as it has been reported that the exonym San is perceived as a pejorative
                        in parts of the central Kalahari. By the late 1990s, the term San was in general use by the
                        people themselves. The adoption of the term was preceded by a number of meetings held in the
                        1990s where delegates debated on the adoption of a collective term.
                        <br><br>
                        These meetings included
                        the Common Access to Development Conference organised by the Government of Botswana held in
                        Gaborone in 1993, the 1996 inaugural Annual General Meeting of the Working Group of
                        Indigenous Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA) held in Namibia, and a 1997 conference in
                        Cape Town on "Khoisan Identities and Cultural Heritage" organised by the University of the
                        Western Cape.
                        <br><br>
                        The term San is now standard in South African, and used officially in the
                        blazon of the national coat-of-arms. The "South African San Council" representing San
                        communities in South Africa was established as part of WIMSA in 2001. "Bushmen" is now
                        considered derogatory by many South Africans, to the point where, in 2008, use of
                        boesman (the modern Afrikaans equivalent of "Bushman") in the Die Burger newspaper was brought
                        before the Equality Court, which however ruled that the mere use of the term cannot be taken as
                        derogatory, after the San Council had testified that it had no objection to its use in a
                        positive context.
                        <br><br>
                        The term Basarwa (singular Mosarwa) is used for the San collectively in Botswana.
                        The term is a Bantu (Tswana) word meaning "those who do not rear cattle". Use of the mo/ba-
                        noun class indicates "people who are accepted", as opposed to the use of Masarwa, an older
                        variant which is now considered offensive.
                        <br><br>
                        In Angola they are sometimes referred to as mucancalas, or bosquímanos (a Portuguese
                        adaptation of the Dutch term for "Bushmen"). The terms Amasili and Batwa are sometimes used for
                        them in Zimbabwe. The San are also referred to as Batwa by Xhosa people and as Baroa by
                        Sotho people. The Bantu term Batwa refers to any foraging tribesmen and as such overlaps
                        with the terminology used for the "Pygmoid" Southern Twa of South-Central Africa.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                    <p>
                        The hunter-gatherer San are among the oldest cultures on Earth, and are thought to be
                        descended from the first inhabitants of what is now Botswana and South Africa. The historical
                        presence of the San in Botswana is particularly evident in northern Botswana's Tsodilo Hills
                        region. San were traditionally semi-nomadic, moving seasonally within certain defined areas
                        based on the availability of resources such as water, game animals, and edible plants.
                        Peoples related to or similar to the San occupied the southern shores throughout the eastern
                        shrubland and may have formed a Sangoan continuum from the Red Sea to the Cape of Good Hope.
                        <br><br>
                        From the 1950s through to the 1990s, San communities switched to farming because of
                        government-mandated modernisation programs. Despite the lifestyle changes, they have provided a
                        wealth of information in anthropology and genetics. One broad study of African genetic diversity
                        completed in 2009 found that San people were among the five populations with the highest
                        measured levels of genetic diversity among the 121 distinct African populations
                        sampled. Certain San groups are one of 14 known extant "ancestral population
                        clusters"; that is, "groups of populations with common genetic ancestry, who share ethnicity and
                        similarities in both their culture and the properties of their languages".
                        <br><br>
                        Despite some positive aspects of government development programs reported by members of San and
                        Bakgalagadi communities in Botswana, many have spoken of a consistent sense of exclusion from
                        government decision-making processes, and many San and Bakgalagadi have alleged experiencing
                        ethnic discrimination on the part of the government: 8–9  The United States Department of
                        State described ongoing discrimination against San, or Basarwa, people in Botswana in 2013 as
                        the "principal human rights concern" of that country.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Society</h3>
                    <p>
                        The San kinship system reflects their interdependence as traditionally small mobile foraging
                        bands. San kinship is comparable to Eskimo kinship, with the same set of terms as in European
                        cultures, but also uses a name rule and an age rule. The age rule resolves any confusion arising
                        from kinship terms, as the older of two people always decides what to call the younger.
                        Relatively few names circulate (approximately 35 names per sex), and each child is named after a
                        grandparent or another relative, but never their parents.
                        <br><br>
                        Children have no social duties besides playing, and leisure is very important to San of all
                        ages. Large amounts of time are spent in conversation, joking, music, and sacred dances. Women
                        have a high status in San society, are greatly respected, and may be leaders of their own family
                        groups. They make important family and group decisions and claim ownership of water holes and
                        foraging areas. Women are mainly involved in the gathering of food, but may also take part in
                        hunting.
                        <br><br>
                        Water is important in San life. Droughts may last many months and waterholes may dry up. When
                        this happens, they use sip wells. To get water this way, a San scrapes a deep hole where the
                        sand is damp. Into this hole is inserted a long hollow grass stem. An empty ostrich egg is used
                        to collect the water. Water is sucked into the straw from the sand, into the mouth, and then
                        travels down another straw into the ostrich egg.
                        <br><br>
                        Traditionally, the San were an egalitarian society. Although they had hereditary chiefs,
                        their authority was limited. The San made decisions among themselves by consensus, with
                        women treated as relative equals. San economy was a gift economy, based on giving each other
                        gifts regularly rather than on trading or purchasing goods and services.
                        <br><br>
                        Most San are monogamous, but if a hunter is skilled enough to get a lot of food, he can afford
                        to have a second wife as well.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Subsistence</h4>
                    <p>
                        Villages range in sturdiness from nightly rain shelters in the warm spring (when people move
                        constantly in search of budding greens), to formalised rings, wherein people congregate in the
                        dry season around permanent waterholes. Early spring is the hardest season: a hot dry period
                        following the cool, dry winter. Most plants still are dead or dormant, and supplies of autumn
                        nuts are exhausted. Meat is particularly important in the dry months when wildlife can not range
                        far from the receding waters.
                        <br><br>
                        Women gather fruit, berries, tubers, bush onions, and other plant materials for the band's
                        consumption. Ostrich eggs are gathered, and the empty shells are used as water containers.
                        Insects provide perhaps 10% of animal proteins consumed, most often during the dry season.
                        Depending on location, the San consume 18 to 104 species, including grasshoppers, beetles,
                        caterpillars, moths, butterflies, and termites.
                        <br><br>
                        Women's traditional gathering gear is simple and effective: a hide sling, a blanket, a cloak
                        called a kaross to carry foodstuffs, firewood, smaller bags, a digging stick, and perhaps, a
                        smaller version of the kaross to carry a baby.
                        <br><br>
                        Men hunt in long, laborious tracking excursions. They kill their game using bow and arrows and
                        spears tipped in diamphotoxin, a slow-acting arrow poison produced by beetle larvae of the genus
                        Diamphidia.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Early history</h4>
                    <p>
                        A set of tools almost identical to that used by the modern San and dating to 42,000 BC was
                        discovered at Border Cave in KwaZulu-Natal in 2012.
                        <br><br>
                        Historical evidence shows that certain San communities have always lived in the desert regions
                        of the Kalahari; however, eventually nearly all other San communities in southern Africa were
                        forced into this region. The Kalahari San remained in poverty where their richer neighbours
                        denied them rights to the land. Before long, in both Botswana and Namibia, they found their
                        territory drastically reduced.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Genetics</h3>
                    <p>
                        Various Y chromosome studies show that the San carry some of the most divergent (oldest) human
                        Y-chromosome haplogroups. These haplogroups are specific sub-groups of haplogroups A and B, the
                        two earliest branches on the human Y-chromosome tree.
                        <br><br>
                        Mitochondrial DNA studies also provide evidence that the San carry high frequencies of the
                        earliest haplogroup branches in the human mitochondrial DNA tree. This DNA is inherited only
                        from one's mother. The most divergent (oldest) mitochondrial haplogroup, L0d, has been
                        identified at its highest frequencies in the southern African San groups.
                        <br><br>
                        In a study published in March 2011, Brenna Henn and colleagues found that the ǂKhomani San, as
                        well as the Sandawe and Hadza peoples of Tanzania, were the most genetically diverse of any
                        living humans studied. This high degree of genetic diversity hints at the origin of anatomically
                        modern humans.
                        <br><br>
                        A 2008 study suggested that the San may have been isolated from other original ancestral groups
                        for as much as 100,000 years and later rejoined, re-integrating into the rest of the human gene
                        pool.
                        <br><br>
                        A DNA study of fully sequenced genomes, published in September 2016, showed that the ancestors
                        of today's San hunter-gatherers began to diverge from other human populations in Africa about
                        200,000 years ago and were fully isolated by 100,000 years ago.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Ancestral land conflict in Botswana</h3>
                    <p>
                        Much aboriginal people's land in Botswana, including land occupied by the San people (or
                        Basarwa), was conquered during colonisation, and the pattern of loss of land and access to
                        natural resources continued after Botswana's independence. The San have been
                        particularly affected by encroachment by majority peoples and non-indigenous farmers onto land
                        traditionally occupied by San people. Government policies from the 1970s transferred a
                        significant area of traditionally San land to white settlers and majority agro-pastoralist
                        tribes. Much of the government's policy regarding land tended to favor the dominant
                        Tswana peoples over the minority San and Bakgalagadi.
                        <br><br>
                        Loss of land is a major
                        contributor to the problems facing Botswana's indigenous people, including especially the San's
                        eviction from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve. The government of Botswana decided to
                        relocate all of those living within the reserve to settlements outside it. Harassment of
                        residents, dismantling of infrastructure, and bans on hunting appear to have been used to induce
                        residents to leave. The government has denied that any of the relocation was
                        forced. A legal battle followed. The relocation policy may have been intended to
                        facilitate diamond mining by Gem Diamonds within the reserve.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Hoodia traditional knowledge agreement</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hoodia gordonii, used by the San, was patented by the South African Council for Scientific and
                        Industrial Research (CSIR) in 1998, for its presumed appetite suppressing quality. A licence was
                        granted to Phytopharm, for development of the active ingredient in the Hoodia plant, p57
                        (glycoside), to be used as a pharmaceutical drug for dieting. Once this patent was brought to
                        the attention of the San, a benefit-sharing agreement was reached between them and the CSIR in
                        2003. This would award royalties to the San for the benefits of their indigenous knowledge.
                        During the case, the San people were represented and assisted by the Working Group of Indigenous
                        Minorities in Southern Africa (WIMSA), the South African San Council and the South African San
                        Institute.
                        <br><br>
                        This benefit-sharing agreement is one of the first to give royalties to the holders of
                        traditional knowledge used for drug sales. The terms of the agreement are contentious, because
                        of their apparent lack of adherence to the Bonn Guidelines on Access to Genetic Resources and
                        Benefit Sharing, as outlined in the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The San have
                        yet to profit from this agreement, as P57 has still not yet been legally developed and marketed.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Representation in mass media</h3>
                    <h4>Early representations</h4>
                    <p>
                        The San of the Kalahari were first brought to the globalized world's attention in the 1950s by
                        South African author Laurens van der Post. Van der Post grew up in South Africa, and had a
                        respectful lifelong fascination with native African cultures. In 1955, he was commissioned by
                        the BBC to go to the Kalahari desert with a film crew in search of the San. The filmed material
                        was turned into a very popular six-part television documentary a year later. Driven by a
                        lifelong fascination with this "vanished tribe", Van der Post published a 1958 book about this
                        expedition, entitled The Lost World of the Kalahari. It was to be his most famous book.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1961, he published The Heart of the Hunter, a narrative which he admits in the introduction
                        uses two previous works of stories and mythology as "a sort of Stone Age Bible", namely
                        Specimens of Bushman Folklore' (1911), collected by Wilhelm H. I. Bleek and Lucy C. Lloyd, and
                        Dorothea Bleek's Mantis and His Friend. Van der Post's work brought indigenous African cultures
                        to millions of people around the world for the first time, but some people disparaged it as part
                        of the subjective view of a European in the 1950s and 1960s, stating that he branded the San as
                        simple "children of Nature" or even "mystical ecologists". In 1992 by John Perrot and team
                        published the book "Bush for the Bushman" – a "desperate plea" on behalf of the aboriginal San
                        addressing the international community and calling on the governments throughout Southern Africa
                        to respect and reconstitute the ancestral land-rights of all San.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Documentaries and non-fiction</h4>
                    <p>
                        John Marshall, the son of Harvard anthropologist Lorna Marshall, documented the lives of San in
                        the Nyae Nyae region of Namibia over a more than 50-year period. His early film The Hunters,
                        released in 1957, shows a giraffe hunt. A Kalahari Family (2002) is a five-part, six-hour series
                        documenting 50 years in the lives of the Juǀʼhoansi of Southern Africa, from 1951 to 2000.
                        Marshall was a vocal proponent of the San cause throughout his life.[64] His sister Elizabeth
                        Marshall Thomas wrote several books and numerous articles about the San, based in part on her
                        experiences living with these people when their culture was still intact.
                        <br><br>
                        The Harmless People,
                        published in 1959 (revised in 1989), and The Old Way: A Story of the First People, published in
                        2006, are the two primary works. John Marshall and Adrienne Miesmer documented the lives of the
                        ǃKung San people between the 1950s and 1978 in Nǃai, the Story of a ǃKung Woman. This film, the
                        account of a woman who grew up while the San lived as autonomous hunter-gatherers, but who later
                        was forced into a dependent life in the government-created community at Tsumkwe, shows how the
                        lives of the ǃKung people, who lived for millennia as hunter gatherers, were forever changed
                        when they were forced onto a reservation too small to support them.
                        <br><br>
                        South African film-maker Richard Wicksteed has produced a number of documentaries on San
                        culture, history and present situation; these include In God's Places / Iindawo ZikaThixo (1995)
                        on the San cultural legacy in the southern Drakensberg; Death of a Bushman (2002) on the murder
                        of San tracker Optel Rooi by South African police; The Will To Survive (2009), which covers the
                        history and situation of San communities in southern Africa today; and My Land is My Dignity

                        A documentary on San hunting entitled, The Great Dance: A Hunter's Story (2000), directed by
                        Damon and Craig Foster. This was reviewed by Lawrence Van Gelder for the New York Times, who
                        said that the film "constitutes an act of preservation and a requiem".

                        Spencer Wells's 2003 book The Journey of Man—in connection with National Geographic's
                        Genographic Project—discusses a genetic analysis of the San and asserts their genetic markers
                        were the first ones to split from those of the ancestors of the bulk of other Homo sapiens
                        sapiens. The PBS documentary based on the book follows these markers throughout the world,
                        demonstrating that all of humankind can be traced back to the African continent (see Recent
                        African origin of modern humans, the so-called "out of Africa" hypothesis).

                        The BBC's The Life of Mammals (2003) series includes video footage of an indigenous San of the
                        Kalahari desert undertaking a persistence hunt of a kudu through harsh desert conditions. It
                        provides an illustration of how early man may have pursued and captured prey with minimal
                        weaponry.

                        The BBC series How Art Made the World (2005) compares San cave paintings from 200 years ago to
                        Paleolithic European paintings that are 14,000 years old. Because of their similarities, the
                        San works may illustrate the reasons for ancient cave paintings. The presenter Nigel Spivey
                        draws largely on the work of Professor David Lewis-Williams, whose PhD was entitled
                        "Believing and Seeing: Symbolic meanings in southern San rock paintings". Lewis-Williams draws
                        parallels with prehistoric art around the world, linking in shamanic ritual and trance states.

                    <p>
                        A 1969 film, Lost in the Desert, features a small boy, stranded in the desert, who encounters a
                        group of wandering San. They help him and then abandon him as a result of a misunderstanding
                        created by the lack of a common language and culture. The film was directed by Jamie Uys, who
                        returned to the San a decade later with The Gods Must Be Crazy, which proved to be an
                        international hit. This comedy portrays a Kalahari San group's first encounter with an artifact
                        from the outside world (a Coca-Cola bottle). By the time this movie was made, the ǃKung had
                        recently been forced into sedentary villages, and the San hired as actors were confused by the
                        instructions to act out inaccurate exaggerations of their almost abandoned hunting and gathering
                        life.
                        <br><br>
                        "Eh Hee" by Dave Matthews Band was written as an evocation of the music and culture of the San.
                        In a story told to the Radio City audience (an edited version of which appears on the DVD
                        version of Live at Radio City), Matthews recalls hearing the music of the San and, upon asking
                        his guide what the words to their songs were, being told that "there are no words to these
                        songs, because these songs, we've been singing since before people had words". He goes on to
                        describe the song as his "homage to meeting... the most advanced people on the planet".

                        In Peter Godwin's biography When A Crocodile Eats the Sun, he mentions his time spent with the
                        San for an assignment. His title comes from the San's belief that a solar eclipse occurs when a
                        crocodile eats the sun.

                        Laurens van der Post's two novels, A Story Like The Wind (1972) and its sequel, A Far Off Place
                        (1974), made into a 1993 film, are about a white boy encountering a wandering San and his wife,
                        and how the San's life and survival skills save the white teenagers' lives in a journey across
                        the desert.

                        James A. Michener's The Covenant (1980), is a work of historical fiction centered on South
                        Africa. The first section of the book concerns a San community's journey set roughly in 13,000
                        BC.

                        Tad Williams's epic Otherland series of novels features a South African San named ǃXabbu, whom
                        Williams confesses to be highly fictionalised, and not necessarily an accurate representation.
                        In the novel, Williams invokes aspects of San mythology and culture.

                    <h3>Botswanan art</h3>
                    <p>
                        The visual art of Botswana has varied among different ethnic group and throughout history.
                        Historically it has fallen into two main categories: that of the San peoples (also known as the
                        Bushmen) and that of the Bantu-derived peoples such as the Batswana.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>San art</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first is of greater antiquity in origin, and includes decoration of many of the devices and
                        equipment the San needed for desert existence. Items such as ostrich shells, clay water filters,
                        animal skins, arrows, bows and pots often received added decoration by way of incised or relief
                        decoration, imprinted pottery decoration, beading and carving. These tribes also carved art
                        objects that had no other function, most often of animals.
                        <br><br>
                        A more ancient art is that of San rock art, for which the San are justifiably famous: right
                        across the South-East African region their ancestors left dynamic paintings on rock faces and
                        cave walls, executed in unknown and highly resilient pigments that have lasted millennia.
                        Depictions of animals, hunts, ceremonies and dances are common. The Tsodilo Hills in Botswana
                        were recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2001, containing some 4,500 rock paintings in
                        total; not all the art covered by this designation is by San people or their ancestors. Most
                        paintings may be from the last 1000 or 2000 years, although much older dates are sometimes
                        claimed. It is difficult to date most paintings; often radiocarbon dating methods can be used
                        for materials on the floor of a shelter, but these may not relate to the dates of the art.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Bantu art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tswana and other Bantu peoples' art is more similar to that of Bantu peoples in the rest of
                        southeastern Africa. Sophisticated carvings of stone and wood (usually of animals or people),
                        sculptures and pottery; 'township' art made of disca instruments, carved walking sticks,
                        knobkerries and many other art forms. One art that is particularly developed in Botswana is the
                        preparation and marketing of hides and furs that have been stitched together, often combined in
                        decorative panels using the different fur types and colours from different animals. These can
                        have a definite use as well, being derived originally from the 'kaross' or desert blanket suited
                        to the very cold conditions of the Kalahari at night and in winter. Woollen and crocheted
                        blankets in local patterns are also popular. Basket weaving is also carried out to a high level
                        of skill and variation.
                        <br><br>
                        There is a great deal of overlap between the two groups' artwork: for example the wire, ironwork
                        and beads used in San items would have been obtained by trade from Bantu peoples, who themselves
                        would have obtained some of their raw art material such as skins and animal horns from the San.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Modern art</h3>
                    <p>
                        These days the art industry thrives in the production of items for tourist consumption. The
                        Okavango swamp, some parts of the Kalahari desert tourist trail and various game reserves all
                        support active local art industries. The major towns also have tourist galleries. Some
                        artists, including white Botswana residents, paint two dimensional pictures of wildlife for the
                        same market, which also includes various items such as T-shirts, hunting knives, shoes and hats.
                        Leather-work is also popular, as are items made from legally cullerded or utilitarian urban
                        objects such as bottle tops and wire; drums, beading, rattles, musical instruments such as the
                        mbira and stringed animals such as elephant hair bracelets.
                        <br><br>
                        During Apartheid, South African artists in exile gathered in Botswana under the name Medu Art
                        Ensemble to produce political artwork. The National Art Gallery at the Botswana National
                        Museum displays traditional and contemporary art.

                    <p>
                        The San religion is the traditional religion and mythology of the San people. It is poorly
                        attested due to their interactions with Christianity.

                        them. It is used in Juǀʼhoan as the word for the Christian god. It has been misinterpreted as

                    <h3>Trance</h3>
                    <p>
                        To enter the spirit world, trance has to be initiated by a shaman through the hunting of a
                        tutelary spirit or power animal. The eland often serves as power animal. The fat of the
                        eland is used symbolically in many rituals including initiations and rites of passage. Other
                        animals such as giraffe, kudu and hartebeest can also serve this function.
                        <br><br>
                        One of the most important rituals in the San religion is the great dance, or the trance dance.
                        This dance typically takes a circular form, with women clapping and singing and men dancing
                        rhythmically. Although there is no evidence that the Kalahari San use hallucinogens regularly,
                        student shaman may use hallucinogens to go into trance for the first time.
                        <br><br>
                        Psychologists have investigated hallucinations and altered states of consciousness in
                        neuropsychology. They found that entoptic phenomena can occur through rhythmic dancing, music,
                        sensory deprivation, hyperventilation, prolonged and intense concentration and migraines. The
                        psychological approach explains rock art through three trance phases. In the first phase of
                        trance an altered state of consciousness would come about. People would experience geometric
                        shapes commonly known as entoptic phenomena. These would include zigzags, chevrons, dots,
                        flecks, grids, vortices and U-shapes. These shapes can be found especially in rock engravings of
                        Southern Africa.
                        <br><br>
                        During the second phase of trance people try to make sense of the entoptic phenomena. They would
                        elaborate the shape they had 'seen' until they had created something that looked familiar to
                        them. Shamans experiencing the second phase of trance would incorporate the natural world into
                        their entoptic phenomena, visualizing honeycombs or other familiar shapes.
                        <br><br>
                        In the third phase a radical transformation occurs in mental imagery. The most noticeable change
                        is that the shaman becomes part of the experience. Subjects under laboratory conditions have
                        found that they experience sliding down a rotating tunnel, entering caves or holes in the
                        ground. People in the third phase begin to lose their grip on reality and hallucinate monsters
                        and animals of strong emotional content. In this phase, therianthropes in rock painting can be
                        explained as heightened sensory awareness that gives one the feeling that they have undergone a
                        physical transformation.

                    <h3>Rock art</h3>
                    <p>
                        Pictographs can be found across Southern Africa in places such as the cave sandstone of
                        KwaZulu-Natal, Free State and North-Eastern Cape, the granite and Waterberg sandstone of the
                        Northern Transvaal, the Table Mountain sandstone of the Southern and Western Cape. Images of
                        conflict and war-making are not uncommon. There are also often images of therianthrophic
                        entities which have both human and animal traits and are connected to the notion of trancing,
                        but
                        these represent only a fraction of all rock art representations.
                        <br><br>
                        Most commonly portrayed are
                        animals such as the eland, although grey rhebok and hartebeest are also in rock art in places
                        such
                        as Cederberg and Warm Bokkeveld. At uKhahlamba / Drakensberg Park there are paintings thought to
                        be
                        some 3,000 years old which depict humans and animals, and are thought to have religious
                        significance.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>San religion</h3>
                    <p>
                        The San religion is the traditional religion and mythology of the San people. It is poorly
                        attested due to their interactions with Christianity.
                    </p><br>

                    <h3>Gods and mythical figures</h3>
                    <p>ǀXam <br>
                        The ǀXam prayed to the Sun and Moon. Many myths are ascribed to various stars.
                    <ul>
                        <li>ǀKágge̥n (sometimes corrupted to "Cagn") is Mantis, a demiurge and hero in ǀXam folklore. He
                            is a trickster god who can shape-shift. He and his wife ǀHúnntuǃattǃatte̥n.</li>
                        <li>ǀHúnntuǃattǃatte̥n (also known as or corrupted to "Coti"), the Dassie, adopted !Xo,
                            Porcupine, as their daughter.</li>
                        <li>!Xo, Porcupine, as their parents ǀKágge̥n and ǀHúnntuǃattǃatte̥n, married Ichneumon, son was
                            the Ichneumon.</li>
                        <li>/Kwammang-a, a dangerous stranger carnivore, married !Xo, son was the Ichneumon.</li>
                        <li>Ichneumon, a small, furry carnivore, mongoose.</li>
                        <li>ǂKá̦gára and ǃHãunu are brothers-in-law who fought with lightning, causing massive storms in
                            the east.</li>

                        Other <br>
                        ǃXu is the Khoikhoi word ǃKhub 'rich man, master', which was used by some Christian missionaries
                        to
                        translate "Lord" in the Bible, and repeated by San people in reporting what the Khoikhoi told
                        them.
                        It is used in Juǀʼhoan as the word for the Christian god. It has been misinterpreted as the
                        "Bushman
                        creator".
